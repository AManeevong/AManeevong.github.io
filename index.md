### CPSC 120

*Lab 7

Lab 7, only had one part, however it was one of my favorites as it was a very interesting concept. It acted almost like a calculator to determine what time you were allowed to park somewhere with the specific street. This peaked my interest as I never knew how programming something like this could be done and it was much more simpler than I thought.

*Lab 10 

Lab 10 also only had one part, but this one was also one of my favorites. It taught me a way to organize a database with a lot of information to something that is more simpler with the specific information I needed. It was also very interesting to incorporate the loops to have the code search the huge database for the information that it was asking for. Even though this was a short lab, I thought it taught a lot and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

*Lab 12

Lab 12, part 2, I thought, was one of the most interesting labs. I knew programming something like a GIF with colors changing would be difficult, however I would have never assumed it would be using something like a random number generator to change those colors. I felt as this lab was a good in between of challenging and fun. I was also able to learn a lot more about how coding something like a GIF worked.
